## 💡Purpuse
As a Software Engineering student,  made this project as a way to apply concepts I learned in my programming classes. In this program, I used elements like structures, classes, pointers, and dynamic arrays, so it was a great way to practice my programming skills before my final exams. While it wasn't coded in the most elegant way, this project was a great way to gain practical experience and helped me improve my coding skills.
